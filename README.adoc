= Supercharger importer

This small project helps importing Supercharger metadata from https://supercharge.info/.
At the moment, only a https://docs.teslamate.org/docs/faq/#what-is-the-geo-fence-feature-for[Teslmate Geo-Fences] query builder is provided.

This is working in progress with no easy way to customize filters and output.
